# FEATURES
#============================================================================================================================

	such as:
	Kanto, Johto, Orre, Hoenn, Unova, Paldea, Vivosaur Island, the world of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon
	Philadelphia, New York City, Nevada, Iceland, Scotland, England, Spain, Chicago, Baltimore, the Appalachian Mountains

-Pseudo open-ended exploration, including:
	Wide "routes" designed in a similar manner to the Wild Area, most comparable in size to Safari Zones & called "Zones"

	A cab service that connects all major settlements in the region
	
-251 region-local Pokémon to capture & continuous rewards for Dex Completion

-Brand-new animated sprites for several post-DS Pokémon provided by a talented lineup of artists

-7 Gyms, specializing in 2 types each, for a total of 14 type-specialized Gym Leaders
	These Gyms can be approached in a pseudo-linear order of your choosing: 1 or 2, then 3 or 4, then 5 or 6, then 7.

-"Skills" replace HMs and can be obtained from clearing a Pokémon Gym, allowing continuous reasons to return to
	each area you previously visited or passed-through for access to more Pokémon and items
	
-Adjustments to the Ice, Water, Bug, Fairy, Rock, and Poison types (Ice, Bug, Rock, and Poison are all improved)
-Frostbite from Pokémon Legends Arceus and Snow from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet
-New items to coincide with the addition of Frostbite & some new healing items

-100 hand-selected TMs and Tutor Moves to aid in Double Battling
-Over 40 brand-new moves to use in battle
-Extensive Move Tutors that can easily be redeemed with Battle Points (1 earned for EVERY battle)

-Buffs for nearly every Pokémon obtainable in the game (with the goal of making all Pokémon at least fun to use)
-New abilities on older Pokémon and adjustments to "less useful" abilities to make them more viable and/or fun

-Customizable Pokémon attributes including:

	Manual ability selection at all Pokémon Centers
	Easily-accessed move tutors
	Easily-accessed "competitive" items
	Move relearner at all Pokémon Centers
	
-An original story focused on [do not read this part if you're FULLY avoiding spoilers]:
	Prophecy
	The Pokémon League and its creation in other regions
	Organized crime and charitable groups
	Young adulthood and family ties
	Self-worth and life direction
	
-A soundtrack featuring dozens of reorchestations of previous Pokémon titles, spinoffs, and other series' games,
	all of which are now using a Black 2 & White 2 Soundfont to make them sound like Generation 5's music
-The wonderful musical talents of numerous Pokémon & Game Musicians from across the internet

-A fully-optional town with tons of extra sidequests to unlock permanent features including:
	A Berry farm
	A Daycare center for breeding
	Rare item sales
	Rare Pokémon localized in the town's grass
	Extra lore about the Ileas Region's social origins

	An "ultimate fight" against [REDACTED]
	
	Oh, come on, we're not going to spoil the postgame story! That would be ridiculous!
