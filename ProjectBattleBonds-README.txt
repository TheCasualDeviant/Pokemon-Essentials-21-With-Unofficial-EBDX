Greetings! This is the README for Project: Battle Bonds and should be packed-in with all files including the game.
Below are all of our disclaimers related to handling of this game, content creation surrounding this game, and other matters.


#-------------------#
# LEGAL DISCLAIMERS #
#-------------------#

As with any fan-created project, materials borrowed for use in this game were not directly authorized to be borrowed by their original rights-holders.
With the development of this game, we have taken strides to ensure that all other legal boundaries are not overstepped, and the project remains
	within colloquially-agreed terms describe "fair use" across the internet. We apologize for not being able to do more in this regard.
	
"Project: Battle Bonds" and Forage Works do not claim any ownership of the Pokémon property, RPGMaker XP, or any of the materials and game systems 
	utilized in the production of this game. 
	We (Forage Works) had a vision and we pursued it solely for the purpose of creating a fun, sharable, and nuanced take on a game formula we all enjoy.
	
All materials created by GAMEFREAK, The Pokémon Company International, and other directly-associated partners were not recreated in this game.

	-Materials borrowed for the construction of this game include the following: animated sprite artwork, concepts, game design elements, and music files.
	
	-All characters contained within this game are either original creations from our team or characters with pre-existing backgrounds in the "core" titles.
	
	-The use of said characters is to be equated to "fan fiction" and was not executed with the intent of claiming their depiction to be official in this title.
	
	-The materials borrowed for the construction of this game cannot be removed from the game files once this game is obtained without decrypting the files. 
	
	-This allows the game to exist as a secure and cohesive whole that will not lead to illegal distribution of the works contained within. Any decryption and
	removal of the files from this game for distribution is not a practice the development team condones.
	
All rights of "Pokémon" belong to GAMEFREAK, The Pokémon Company International, Creatures Inc., and all other related companies including but not limited to 
	Nintendo Co. Ltd. We ask all players who download, play, and discuss this game to continue to support the official series, official release, and all 
	official offshoots to the Pokémon series.
	
Violations of the rights of all shareholders and companies that own Pokémon are heavily discouraged and frowned-upon by Forage Works.
	"Project: Battle Bonds" is a fan-created project that has never had - and will never have - any intention of deriving profit, funding, or monetary
	gain/advantage via sale, distribution, or acquisition of materials utilizing the Pokémon brand and name. 
	This game is intended to be free for all to access, now and forever - along with all of the original materials featured in this game.


And on a personal note:

Fan games are not "replacements" for real games or other media - they are a symbol of love and affection for a property, the artists that brought it
	into reality, and the companies that fostered it to allow it to survive and thrive. 
	Pokémon has not become the largest multimedia franchise in the world without good reason, and the resilience and passion of its fans is proof.


Fans will always continue to develop fan-games, ROM Hack, and deeply inspired or iterative works using properties they love. That is the way of human culture.
	With this in mind, we humbly ask that any and all official personnel who may happen to interact with this game or other fan works across the internet to
	reconsider the elimination and takedown of fan materials that do not derive profit, and instead allow them to grow and flourish uninterrupted, so that
	fans' love for the series will continue to grow and grow. 
	It is our firm belief that stifling the works of fans will only increase negativity and ire towards the original property, thereby decreasing the 
	property's value. Morale is a genuine part of any consumer environment, and treating the fans as obstacles to profit will only deteriorate from the 
	genuine care thousands of people around the world share for your experience.

With all of the above said: we deeply hope you enjoy our game, in spite of the unabashedly legal "gray space" it occupies.

# GAME HANDLING #
#---------------#

	Elite Battle DX (EBDX - previously known as Elite Battle System), and numerous plugins created by the Pokémon Essentials and fan community.

If you obtained this game and/or its files by directly paying the file holder, a website, an individual, or other source any sort of money
	or transactional good, such transaction was made illegally and violates the legal boundaries of the Pokémon license holders and RPGMaker's developers. 
	Please request an immediate refund and contact the relevant authorities of the platform you spent money on. 
	You are fully within your rights to deny a legitimate purchase was made if you acquired this game as a "product" and spent money or some other form 
	of currency to obtain it.
	
None of the assets of this game are authorized to be distributed without express permission from the developers. We will not be distributing any materials 
	created by GAMEFREAK, The Pokémon Company International, and Creatures Inc. used in this game, but we will allow sharing of original materials 
	created for the purposes of this game. Please ask the development team for further information on usage.

Please respect the well-wishes of this game, its developers, and the Pokémon fan community by not involving yourself or others in such illegal
	monetary behaviors and actions regarding the processing of this game. These actions have the potential to damage communities, the RPG Maker brand, 
	and the Pokémon brand, and are not condoned by anyone who was involved in developing this game or the materials used for this game.

# CONTENT CREATION #
#------------------#

We give full authority for all "content creators" to make content about/on "Project: Battle Bonds." 
However, when creating content, we request all content creators follow the below terms:
	
	1. Articles, reports, and other news-related media cannot publish works on this game without prior approval from the developers, Forage Works.
		This request is made solely for the purposes of accessibility and shareability. "Mainstream" and video games journalism attention may bring
		undue media attention to our project in a manner that we are not actively seeking out, and will alert lawyers to our game in ways that the 
		development team is, as with any fan game, unprepared to face.
		
		This request is made with no ill-will, but instead the goal of our game persisting as long as possible and with accessibility to everyone.
		We hope you understand. We respect the work of journalism and wish for our game to persist.
	
	2. Content created about "Project: Battle Bonds" cannot contain any insensitive material including slurs, derogatory terminology, or hate speech.
	
	3. Content created about "Project: Battle Bonds" cannot be used to harm other creators, individuals, or images of others.
	
	4. Content with "Project: Battle Bonds" imagery in thumbnails or promotional fields cannot misrepresent the contents of the game, mislead players
		into information about the game that is false, or attempt to convince players to purchase materials related to the game, as no
		merchandising or monetary acquisition of the game is authorized under any circumstances. (You can "troll" or "clickbait" but nothing more, please!)
		
In other words: be nice, be respectful, and treat everyone who plays this game with common respect and courtesy.

Our team and the world of our game has no place for hatred, sexism, racism, or any other forms of distasteful language and actions in content surrounding this game
	or other Pokémon content. These games are a happy-place for so many, and we want to continue that treasured legacy.

We also highly suggest you inform us that you are making content about our game! We would love to hear and receive all praise and criticisms you may have.

We are happy to "signal boost" content and reviews about the game, if you wish for others to see it. Some of our development team have dabbled in
	content creation in the past, and know how difficult it can be to build an audience. Contact us, and if we see it in time, we'll boost it for you in our Discord!
