README
Greetings! This is the README for Pokémon: Battle Bonds and should be packed-in with all files including the game.
Below are all of our disclaimers related to handling of this game, content creation surrounding this game, and other matters.

GAME HANDLING
---


"Pokémon: Battle Bonds" is a fan-created game engineered using Ruby, developed in RPGMaker XP, and utilizes the systems of Pokémon Essentials,
	Elite Battle DX (EBDX - previously known as Elite Battle System), and numerous plugins created by the Pokémon Essentials and fangame community.
	
"Pokémon: Battle Bonds" and its development team does not claim ownership of the Pokémon IP, RPGMaker XP, or any of the fan-created materials and
	systems utilized in the production of this game. We (the development team) had a vision and we created it solely for the purpose of creating
	a fun, sharable, and nuanced take on a game formula we all enjoy.
	
All rights of Pokémon belong to Nintendo Co. Ltd., GAMEFREAK, The Pokémon Company, Creatures, and all other related companies. Please support the
	official series!

Violations of the rights of all shareholders and companies that own Pokémon are heavily discouraged and frowned-upon by this development team.
	"Pokémon: Battle Bonds" is a fan-created project that has never had - and will never have - any intention of deriving profit, funding, or monetary
	gain/advantage via sale, distribution or acquisition of materials utilizing the Pokémon brand and name. This game is intended to be free for
	all to access, now and forever.
	
If you obtained this game and its files by directly paying the file holder, a website, and individual, or some other person any sort of money
	or transactional good, such transaction was made illegally and violates the rights of the Pokémon license holders, RPGMaker's developers, and
	the developers of this game. Please request an immediate refund, contact the authorities, and contact the developers of Pokémon: Battle Bonds.
	You are fully within your rights to deny a legitimate purchase was made if you acquired this game as a "product" and spent money or some other
	form of currency to obtain it.

Please respect the well-wishes of this game, its developers, and the Pokémon fan game community by not involving yourself or others in such illegal
	monetary behaviors and actions. These actions have the potential to damage communities, the RPGMaker brand, and the Pokémon brand, and are not
	condoned by anyone who was involved in developing this game.

CONTENT CREATION
---


We give full authority for all creators to make content about/on "Pokémon: Battle Bonds." However, when creating content, we request all content
	creators follow the below terms:
	
	1. Content created about "Pokémon: Battle Bonds" cannot contain any insensitive material including slurs, derogatory terminology, or hate speech.
	
	2. Content created about "Pokémon: Battle Bonds" cannot be used to harm other creators, individuals, or images of others.
	
	3. Content with "Pokémon: Battle Bonds" imagery in thumbnails or promotional items cannot misrepresent the contents of the game, mislead players
		into information about the game that is deemed false, or attempt to convince players to purchase materials related to the game, as no
		merchandising or monetary acquisition of the game is authorized under any circumstances.
	
	4. Content with "Pokémon: Battle Bonds" imagery in thumbnails or promotional items cannot contain "Not Safe For Work" imagery including suggestions
		to or presence of pornography, nudity, endangerment, child abuse, drug consumption and/or paraphernalia, and other common "Not Safe For Work"
		categories and subject matters. If you need to ask "is this not safe for work?" then it probably is.
		
In other words: be nice, be respectful, and treat everyone who plays this game with common respect and courtesy.

The development team has no place for hatred, sexism, racism, or any other forms of distasteful language and actions in content surrounding the game
	or other Pokémon content. These games are a happy-place for so many, and we want to continue that treasured legacy.

We also highly suggest you inform us that you make content about our game! We would love to hear and receive all praise and criticisms you may have.

We are happy to "signal boost" content and reviews about the game, if you wish for others to see it. Some of our development team have dabbled in
	content creation in the past, and know how difficult it can be to build an audience.
