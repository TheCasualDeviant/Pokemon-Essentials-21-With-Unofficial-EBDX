POKEMON: BATTLE BONDS - CHANGELOG

~v1.0~

TYPE-RELATED BALANCE CHANGES

1. ICE now resists:

ICE (previously-resisted)
WATER (new)

Justification: By creating a combination resistance between ICE and WATER, the ICE type gains the ability to switch into the
	field against one of the most prominent and useful types in the game. Logically speaking, neither element is consistent
	in their ability to best each-other, so a resistance has been added.
	
	
2. ICE is no-longer weak to ROCK. ICE in reality does enough to erode ROCK that the weakness felt unfair, and ROCK already
	has a lot of advantages that will be addressed via other changes.
	

3. The status effect FREEZE has been replaced with FROSTBITE*, introduced in POKEMON: LEGENDS ARCEUS.

	*FROSTBITE deals damage each turn, equivalent to the rate of BURN. It also cuts Special Attack, while BURN cuts Attack.
	ICE-Type POKEMON are immune to FROSTBITE. All moves that previously inflicted FREEZE will inflict FROSTBITE instead.
	
	A new move, PERMAFROST, has been added as an equivalent to [WILL-O-WISP]. The move [POWDER SNOW] is available as TM57
	and that move has a 30% chance to land FROSTBITE on both opponents.
	

4. The weather effect HAIL has been replaced with SNOW*, introduced in POKEMON: SCARLET and POKEMON: VIOLET.

	*SNOW does not deal damage each turn like HAIL used-to. SNOW raises the Defense of all ICE Type POKEMON on the field at
	the same rate that SANDSTORM boosts ROCK Type POKEMON's Special Defense. The move [HAIL] has been replaced with [SNOWSCAPE].
	The ability [SNOW WARNING] will summon SNOW.
	
	
5. Certain ROCK-type moves have gained accuracy boosts. The move [ROCK SLIDE] as an example has been boosted to 100%
	accuracy in exchange for a decreased flinch chance at 10%. [STRENGTH] has also been made into a ROCK-type attack and
	maintains its 100% accuracy rate.
	
	The overall goal is to make ROCK more offensively-consistent.
	
	
6. ROCK-type Pokémon will now absorb [STEALTH ROCKS] upon entry, similar to how POISON-types absorb [TOXIC SPIKES]. When
	this absorption occurs, the Pokémon will recover 1/16th of its maximum HP one time. (Same heal value as one turn while holding LEFTOVERS)
	
	
7. POISON-type Pokémon will now recover 1/16th of their maximum HP upon absorbing [TOXIC SPIKES] from the field.

	
8. FAIRY type has lost its resistance to BUG type. The BUG type often has few answers to FAIRY and there is little to no
	logical justification to consistently explain why FAIRY, a type related to magic and nature, would resist all insects.
	

9. Multiple brand-new moves for all types are available at the Battle Brigade hub in Ileas City. These moves
	have been introduced to fill gaps in existing typings and help expand each type's capabilities while maintaining what
	makes them all unique. The full list of tutors is available in the NPC/ITEM text document.

GENERAL GAMEPLAY CHANGES

EVs

Effort Values (EVs), gained by defeating POKEMON, can now be manually-set on any POKEMON.
EVs will still be acquired in the same manner as all main series titles. The player now has full control over equipping them.

To set your earned EVs, [DIRECTION HERE]


ABILITIES AND HIDDEN ABILITIES

All Abilities and Hidden Abilities can be swapped at a Pokemon Center. Talk to the nurse to swap abilities.

A Hidden Ability is just an ability that will not appear on the POKEMON when they are in the wild.

Players can freely choose any of the three available abilities for no cost! Strategize and customize to your heart's content!


CONSUMABLE HELD ITEMS IN-BATTLE

For parity with recent titles, consumable held items (Berries, Air Balloon, etc.) will be returned to the holder after battle.


GRIP CLAW

The Grip Claw now has the added effect of the Binding Band item, on top of its existing effect.
As such, the Binding Band is gone from the game. You won't really need it anyway, right?

Item Description below:

A held item that extends the duration and increases the power of multiturn attacks like Bind and Wrap.

Expanded Details:

The Binding Band previously increased damage dealt from 1/8 HP per turn to 1/6 HP per turn.
The Grip Claw previously increased the duration from 2-5 turns to 7 turns guaranteed. 
This effect now lasts 6 turns guaranteed, to coincide with the damage increase not being modified.


SHELL BELL

Inspired by the adjustments made to the Shell Bell in Pokémon Elite Redux, the Shell Bell has been improved.

OLD: Restores the holder's HP by 1/8 of the damage dealt to the opponent.
NEW: Restores the holder's HP by 1/3 of the damage dealt to the opponent.

ABILITY CHANGES

[THERE IS A LOT! THESE ARE ALL BUFFS - SO TRY THE POKEMON OUT THAT GET THESE FOR A FUN TIME!]

DEFEATIST
OLD: Halves the user Attack and Sp. Atk stats when its HP becomes half or less.
NEW: The average accuracy of attacks is multiplied by 0.8x [HUSTLE]. When the user misses an attack, their Attack and 
	Special Attack are decreased by one stage each.
	
DAMP
OLD: Prevents the use of explosive moves such as Self-Destruct by dampening its surroundings.
NEW: Prevents the use of explosive moves such as Self-Destruct by dampening its surroundings. Upon entering the field,
	the user decreases the power of FIRE-Type attacks by dampening the field [WATER SPORT].
	
FLOWER VEIL
OLD: Ally GRASS-Type POKEMON are protected from status conditions and the lowering of their stats.
NEW: Ally GRASS-Type POKEMON and the user are both protected from status conditions and the lowering of their stats.

KEEN EYE

PICKPOCKET > SLEIGHT OF HAND

NEW: The user steals the held item of an opposing POKEMON when it is hit by their move.

EXPANDED: [PICKPOCKET] and [MAGICIAN] have essentially had their effects swapped. To help with potential confusion, they have
	been given new names to set them apart from each other further. All POKEMON that previously got one will get the new one
	with its new name. This is both for balancing purposes and "logical" purposes, as it makes more sense for a pickpocket to
	actively bump into (or in this case, attack) something to pilfer an item.

RUN AWAY
OLD: The user can flee any encounter without fail. The user cannot switch after a MEAN LOOK or BLOCK.
NEW: The user can flee any encounter without fail. The user boosts their Speed by one stage upon entering the field. The

NEW: The POKEMON is [influenced] by [static electricity/poisons/fire], so contact with the foe may induce
	[PARALYSIS/POISON/BURN].
	NOTE - EFFECT OF ALL THREE ABOVE ABILITIES IS 20% 
	
	EXPANDED DETAIL:
	Activates when the POKEMON attacks its opponents with a move that causes CONTACT
	AND
	Activates when the opponent uses an attack that requires CONTACT against the user
	[Think of it like this: Poison Point + Poison Touch put together, but with a slightly lower rate of 20% for all three 
	of these abilities. It will feel both more & less frequent. You'll see for yourself.]
	
FLOWER GIFT
OLD: CHERRIM's ATTACK and SPECIAL DEFENSE are boosted by 1.5x in harsh sunlight.
NEW: CHERRIM'S DEFENSE is boosted by 1.5x in its [BUD FORM]. In sunlight, CHERRIM and its ally's ATTACK and SPECIAL DEFENSE
